# Fastmail

Let's take a look at the Fastmail API tokens!

We can use the examples Fastmail have provided in their JMAP-Samples repository:

https://github.com/fastmail/JMAP-Samples/tree/main/javascript

The samples include a hello-world sample which creates an email draft and a
top-ten sample, which lists the top of the inbox.

The samples use the `fetch` API natively available in the Node API.
Node 18+ must be used to run them.
NPM is not needed.
I opened an issue related to this: https://github.com/fastmail/JMAP-Samples/issues/16

The samples are run as such:

```bash
JMAP_USERNAME=tomas@hubelbauer.net JMAP_TOKEN=fmu1-â€¦ node hello-world/top-ten
```

`JMAP_USERNAME` is the email address.

`JMAP_TOKEN` is the token from https://www.fastmail.com/settings/security/tokens

If you omit either of `JMAP_USERNAME` or `JMAP_TOKEN`, the script will notify
you.

## Locked Down Tokens

As of current, I don't see a way to limit a token to a subset of the inbox.
This is a crucial feature in order to avoid leaking my inbox on token leak.
That's a concern when using the token on a 3rd party infrastructure, like CI/CD.

I emailed jmapsupport@fastmail.com and suggested several options of introducing
locked down tokens including associating tokens with folders, patterns (would
operate on email data and metadata), aliases etc.
Later on I found out about Sieve, a filtering and actioning programming language
supported by Fastmail for automated email management.
I have updated my suggestion to say that associating a piece of Sieve code to a
token seems like a preferrable solution.

## Webhooks

In the same conversation where I asked Fastmail about locked down tokens, I have
also inquired about the possibility of adding webhooks which fire when new email
is received.
This would introduce on option of having automations react to new email instead
of poll for new email.
Similarly to the locked down tokens, associating Sieve code with the webhook
seems like the best way to specify what email it should apply to.
